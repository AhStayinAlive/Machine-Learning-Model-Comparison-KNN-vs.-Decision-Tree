# Machine-Learning-Model-Comparison-KNN-vs.-Decision-Tree
The project compares K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree algorithms. It evaluates their precision, recall, and accuracy in predicting solubility classes. KNN achieves 75% precision, 77% recall, and 77% accuracy, while Decision Tree scores 71%, 73%, and 73%, respectively. KNN is more accurate but slower.
