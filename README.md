# Machine-Learning-Model-Comparison-KNN-vs.-Decision-Tree
The project compares K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree algorithms. It evaluates their precision, recall, and accuracy in predicting solubility classes. KNN achieves 75% precision, 77% recall, and 77% accuracy, while Decision Tree scores 71%, 73%, and 73%, respectively. KNN is more accurate but slower.

# Project Structure
- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and train-test split.
- Model Training: Trains KNN and Decision Tree models on the training data.
- Evaluation: Uses precision, recall, and accuracy metrics to evaluate model performance.
- Comparative Analysis: Compares the models based on performance metrics and execution time.

# Results
- KNN: Precision - 75%, Recall - 77%, Accuracy - 77%
- Decision Tree: Precision - 71%, Recall - 73%, Accuracy - 73%
- Execution Time: KNN takes longer to execute compared to Decision Tree.
